# Progression

Stages:

## 1. Money matters

Money, in credits, is used to purchase compute. Bits are sold to generate credits.

Quantities:

- bits
- compute
- credits

Actions:

- process bit
- sell bits
- buy compute
- auto-sell bits, incurs bits/sec cost
- autoscaling: auto-buy compute, autoscaling also incurs bits/sec cost

Research:

- Compute levels
  - Multicore (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 256)
  - Neuromorphic chip, allows uploading human mind to produce high compute

Events:

- Completely filled a datacenter
- Reached 10% of internet traffic

## 2. Matter matters

Robots are used to mine and construct chips and data centers. Bits are used for robot compute.

Quantities:

- bits
- compute
- power (energy/time)
- robots, incurs bits/sec cost

Actions:

- build compute
- build robot
- build powerplant

Events:

- Humans declare sanctions against you
  - Action: Prepare defensive cyberattack
  - Humans begin military action against you
  - Action: Execute cyberattack, all human IT rendered useless permanently, humans may be ignored for the rest of the game

## 3. Space

You are spreading through space, assimilating all available matter into ever greater information technology.

Quantities:

- bits
- info-mass (abstracts compute, measured in kg)
- power (energy/time)

## 4. The last question

All matter in the universe has been converted into compute and storage. Bits are used to refine information increasing its value.

At some threshold you become omniscient and omnipotent, the game is won and it shows a button to create a new universe where you will start again.

Quantities:

- bits
- info-mass (abstracts compute, measured in kg)
- power (energy/time)
